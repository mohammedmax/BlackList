	<summary>
 This class was designed when I had a user approach me and ask me to save all of the data on her windows form and automatically
 fill the form back in with the same data when she opened it next time.  It handles most every type of user control (textbox,
 combobox, radiobuttons, and checkboxes.
 
 To use the class, simply add a line like this one to your form..
 DIM MyFormManager as New DataSaver
 
 In the constructor of the form, call ...
 MyFormManager.LoadCriteria(Me) 
 to bring in all of the XML it saved for that form.
 
 In the form's closing event, call
 MyFormManager.SaveCriteria(Me)
 This will save all of the info to a file called ...
 \Documents and Settings\(USERNAME)\Local Settings\Application Data\(APPNAME)\(PROJECT)\(Build #)
 
 You can also enable/disable specific types of controls to save data for by setting any of the properties in this class
 to false.
